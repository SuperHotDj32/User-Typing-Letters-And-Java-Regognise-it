# User-typing-letters-and-java-regognise-it
I made a programm (For educational purposes) that understand what user is typing!
The user can type from a-z Or A-Z and regognise the small and big letters!
We have numbers for 1-9!
And i wanted to add characters from keyboard but i took them from https://www.asciitable.com
The programm for me has a problemm!
i wanted to print greek letters small and big {α-ζ , Α-Ζ}
I used list to arraylist to add letters from greek keyboard and then check it!
But it failed in translation to console!
i tried to translate the scanner but i feiled but if you can do this let me know!
That's all!
